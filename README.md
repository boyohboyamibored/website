# My website

This is currently using flask at the moment, and it's still in the testing phase.  
Any feedback would be appreciated.

To setup,

```bash
# clone the directory
git clone https://www.github.com/boyohboyamibored/website.git website
cd website

# create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# source it
source env/bin/activate

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run it
python main.py
```
